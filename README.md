# ionicAppuniversity

A system of applications has been designed and developed within a university system. It consists of 2 applications: (i) a
web app usable by the secretaries to manage the data of the domain (classrooms, teachers, courses, lessons, etc.) and the
reports made by teachers, who in addition to report problems to the secretariat (small classrooms, faulty devices, etc..) or
view those already present in the system, can upload teaching material (pdf, images, links, bibliography, etc..); (ii) a
mobile app that can be used by students to receive notifications when the teachers upload teaching materials, download
the teaching materials or provide an evaluation from 1 to 5 for each lesson or teaching material; teachers receive
notifications about changes in the status of the reports or a new evaluation by the students. In addition, both teachers and
students use the mobile app to communicate via course chat rooms, view the lessons of the day, or receive notifications of
lesson changes. 

This project is the mobile application og the university system and it is built using the Ionic framework.
